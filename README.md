# Mealfinder
 I create a a meal finder App
#Problem Statement
 Create a meal app to store and search meals. Use ONLY vanilla javascript, no libraries or frameworks allowed for Javascript.

#Features
#Home Page
    Search any meal from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions).
    Each search result of the meal should have a favourite button
#Meal Detail Page
    Should show information about the meal like its name, photo, instructions, etc (these are must, rest you can add if you want).
